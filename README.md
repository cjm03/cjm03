## Experience
I have extensive experience in high stakes environments where months of work can be lost overnight without proper risk management. 
My specialty is building and protecting assets in hostile, competitive environments, where security is never guaranteed.
I've successfully operated in environments where progress demanded constant resource gathering and investment.
I've discovered that creatively diversifying asset storage is the only viable way to stay ahead of the competition. 
Along with confident assessments of trust and cautious risk evaluation, I strategically and meticulously can overcome any challenge thrown at me. 
I understand that collaboration offers advantages, but also creates significant vulnerabilities. 
I've learned to cost-benefit every collaboration, maintain spotless operational security, and prepare for betrayal as the default scenario, not an exception. 
Finally, I accept and hold that Zero-Trust architecture is the best strategy.
